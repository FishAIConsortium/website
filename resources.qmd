>The publication details an advanced methodological framework for fish detection, identification, and 3D tracking. Utilizing YOLOv5 for object detection, iNaturalist data for species identification, and DeepSORT for multi-object tracking, it describes and presents code for precise classification and tracking from stereo-video. Additionally, it includes code for data optimization and calculating rates of energy expenditure from fish movement. This integration of AI with conventional field methods enhances our understanding of energy dynamics in aquatic ecosystems.

>This publication contributes to the discussion on the responsible use of media from online repositories for AI training. It offers best practices along the FAIR principles to help researchers use these resources ethically and legally. Particularly valuable is the comprehensive overview of Creative Commons (CC) licences and their implications for the use of CC licensed media in AI training, enabling researchers to understand and comply with the nuanced requirements of different licence types.

*(In progress)*

Our specific goals are to:

1)	build upon the efforts of existing groups to expand coordination and collaboration, including resources, data sharing, general knowledge and experiences;

2)	make artificial intelligence resources more accessible and useful for fish ecology research and for conservation practitioners by providing information and training resources such as workshops and webinars;

3)	build a bank of publicly available? fish images (newly collected data or from existing initiatives) which can be used to develop or improve AI models;

4)	explore approaches (for example ensemble learning) to combine machine learning models to build global models (e.g. fish species identification, subspecies identification, species ecotypes, etc);

5)	increase cross-disciplinary collaboration among fish biologists, fisheries researchers, computer scientists, and conservation practitioners.

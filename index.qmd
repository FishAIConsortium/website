<br/><br/>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Our goals</h1>


<p style="text-align: center;">1)  Build upon the existing efforts to expand coordination and collaboration, including resources, data sharing, general knowledge and experiences

2)  Make artificial intelligence resources more accessible for research and management, by developing user friendly applications and providing information and training

3)  Build a bank of expert identified fish images which can be used to develop or improve AI models

4)  Explore approaches to combine existing fish species identification models to build larger, global models

5)  Increase cross-disciplinary collaboration among fish biologists, fisheries researchers, computer scientists and conservation practitioners.</p>

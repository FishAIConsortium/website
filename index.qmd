The Artificial Intelligence for Fish Monitoring Consortium is an international initiative that aims to bring together people with an interest in using artificial intelligence tools to better understand fish population dynamics, ecology and conservation.
|


# Our goals


Our specific goals are to:
*(In progress)*

1)	build upon the efforts of existing groups to expand coordination and collaboration, including resources, data sharing, general knowledge and experiences;

2)	make artificial intelligence resources more accessible and useful for fish ecology research and for conservation practitioners by providing information and training resources such as workshops and webinars;

3)	build a bank of publicly available? fish images (newly collected data or from existing initiatives) which can be used to develop or improve AI models;

4)	explore approaches (for example ensemble learning) to combine machine learning models to build global models (e.g. fish species identification, subspecies identification, species ecotypes, etc);

5)	increase cross-disciplinary collaboration among fish biologists, fisheries researchers, computer scientists, and conservation practitioners.
